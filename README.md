# Muh Dotfiles

No symlinks just a simple scripts

:tada:

### Caveats

Must clone repo at root of Documents directory.

```bash
cd $HOME/Documents && git clone https://github.com/selfup/dotfiles.git
```

All popular operating systems come with this Directory by default (Ubuntu, Windows, MacOS), so might as well use it!
