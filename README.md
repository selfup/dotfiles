No symlinks just simple scripts

### Caveats

Must clone repo at root of Documents directory.

It's just something I do. All repos live there :smile:

If I need to namespace, I namespace inside of the Documents dir.

All Operating Systems come with this Directory by default (Ubuntu, Windows, MacOS), so might as well use it!

:pray:
